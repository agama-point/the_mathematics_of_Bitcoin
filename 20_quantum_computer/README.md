### Quantum Computing Experiments

Check out the repository here: [Quantum Computing Experiments](https://github.com/octopusengine/quantum_computing)

This repository focuses on **basic operations with qubits**, which can be tested and explored using **quantum simulators**. Our work in this area has been ongoing **since 2023**, providing practical examples and experiments for anyone interested in learning or experimenting with quantum computing.


We aim to provide a hands-on approach for beginners and enthusiasts to understand **superposition, entanglement, and basic quantum gates** without requiring access to real quantum hardware.
